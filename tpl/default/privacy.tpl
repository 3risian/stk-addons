    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The SuperTuxKart Add-Ons website (hereafter noted as STKAddons) is a service
       provided to complement the SuperTuxKart racing game (STK). The information
       collected by this website is to be used solely to enrich the quality of the STK
       game.
    </p>

    <h2>Collected Information</h2>
    <p>
        Upon registering to use the STKAddons site, you are required to provide an
       e-mail address and you are asked to provide a name. We do not require that the
       name you provide accurately represents your real name. (i.e. you are permitted
       to use an alias or a nickname.) You may also choose to provide other kinds of
       information as noted below.
    </p>
    <p>
       As you interact with the STKAddons service, a variety of data is collected.
       For example, while you are logged in you may submit content to be hosted by the
       STKAddons service. We require that all submissions clearly state the names of
       any individuals involved in creating the content to provide credit for their
       work. You would be expected to provide a personally identifiable name to claim
       credit for your work. Again, this is not required to be your real name.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to this, while logged in you are able to rate the content of
       other users. When you do so, your vote towards the content's rating is
       associated with your user account. Votes are only displayed in an aggregated
       format.
    </p>
    <p>
        When connecting to the STKAddons service from STK, we also collect some non-
       personally-idenifying information about what operating system you are using.
       As well, all connections to the STKAddons website are logged by our web server.
       This information contains your IP address or public hostname and browser user-
       agent. We do not actively monitor this information, and it is collected as a
       consequence of the web-server software that we (and most site operators) use.
    </p>
    <p>
        When signing in to the STKAddons service from STK, we store information
       required to maintain a user session within the STK game, similar to a session
       cookie in a web browser. We also store the player's gained achievements and
       they may create a friends list.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you grant permission in-game, we will also collect anonymous statistics
       related to your system configuration (screen resolution, gl_ext list, video card
       model), performance (average fps, both overall and per track), and asset usage
       (how many times you use each track and kart). You will be asked to enable this
       data collection when you launch the game for the first time. This will allow us
       to determine which assets to focus on improving, and how much we can increase
       the graphical demands of the game. (This is NOT implemented as of STK 0.8.1 but
       may exist in a future release.)
    </p>

    <h3>COPPA Compliance (United States)</h3>
    <p>
        In order to comply with United States law despite not operating in that
       jurisdiction, we do not knowingly collect the personal information of persons
       under the age of 13 from this region without parental consent. If we discover
       that a user is in fact a child from this region, their account will be suspended
       until parental consent is obtained, or if parental consent is not obtained in
       a timely manner, their account and all related information will be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the small amount of information we collect, and the inability of
       our organization to provide a mailing address or toll-free telephone number in
       the United States, we only require an email with an accompanying digital
       signature from a parent/legal guardian to either grant or deny us permission to
       collect this personal information. This can be sent to
       <code>supertuxkart.official@gmail.com</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
         The STKAddons service uses cookies to remember your login state, as well as to
        remember which language you wish to use the service in. At this time, we do not
        employ the use of cookie-based analytics services.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>
    <p>
        The operators of STKAddons will never disclose your personal notification to
       third parties except as noted below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you register for STKAddons, a profile page is created for you. This page
       is visible to all other registered users of the STKAddons service. This page
       displays the name you enetered at registration time, the date you registered,
       your user rank, and links to any content you have submitted through the
       STKAddons service.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you upload content to the STKAddons service, any information you place
       in the license file of the content becomes publicly visible from the website.
       Anything else you include in your uploaded file is also publicly available by
       other means. As well, the name you registered with is displayed on the page
       promoting the content you submitted, with a link to your profile page.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not make available any indication of what rating you have provided for
       the content uploaded to STKAddons. However, this information is used to generate
       an average rating as provided by all users of the service.
    </p>
    <p>
       We do not display your e-mail address publicly anywhere on the STKAddons
       website, unless you provide it in some uploaded content package. The website
       moderators do not have direct access to your e-mail address, however this
       information is stored in plain-text in our database. You will never
       be contacted by e-mail through the STKAddons service except for the following:
       confirming that you are a real person when registering, resetting your password,
       and receiving feedback from moderators for any content you have submitted. We
       reserve the right to extend this list as the service evolves, and to notify you
       of changes to this policy. We will never disclose your e-mail address to third
       parties.
    </p>
